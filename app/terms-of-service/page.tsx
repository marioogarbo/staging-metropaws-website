          Membership and digital account activation do not automatically mean that
          every service benefit is immediately available. Annual and monthly payment
          arrangements have different activation and benefit-eligibility controls.

          activation, provided that MetroPaws has completed registration, agreement

          A Member who chooses the monthly installment subscription shall not be
          entitled to full service-benefit utilization immediately upon payment of
          the first monthly installment. Monthly subscription activation is
          conditional and requires completion of registration, payment verification,
          Digital Pet Passport or Pet ID issuance, agreement acceptance and the
          consecutive-payment preconditions in this Section.

        <Subheading>
          5.3 Initial Account Activation After First Monthly Payment
        </Subheading>
        <Paragraph>
          Upon successful payment of the first monthly installment and completion of
          onboarding requirements, MetroPaws may activate the Member account for
          digital access only. Digital access may include the app, Digital Pet
          Passport, pet profile management, wellness reminders, PawPoints account
          creation, community access, educational content and other low-risk digital
          features. Initial digital activation does not automatically unlock full
          Service Authorization eligibility or direct Provider Settlement.
        </Paragraph>

        <Subheading>5.4 Consecutive Payment Requirement</Subheading>
        <Paragraph>
          A monthly subscriber must complete the required number of consecutive,
          uninterrupted and successfully cleared monthly payments before becoming
          eligible to request designated planned service benefits, direct provider
          payment, emergency support, approved exception reimbursement or other
          higher-value benefits. This requirement protects financial sustainability
          and reduces enrollment solely for immediate high-value utilization.

          Full planned-service eligibility means the Member may submit a Service
          Request for eligible consultation, vaccination, deworming, grooming or
          other covered categories. It does not mean automatic approval. Every
          request remains subject to benefit availability, service interval, advance

          exclusions, member share and other controls.

        <Paragraph>
          Any missed, late, reversed, dishonored, cancelled, refunded or disputed
          monthly payment may result in suspension of service-benefit eligibility,
          cancellation or expiry of pending authorizations, and restriction of direct
          provider payment. MetroPaws may reset the consecutive-payment qualification
          period to zero or restore it only to the last approved good-standing
          status, depending on the account history, reason for default and approved
          payment-risk policy.

          The app, invoice, official notice or account dashboard may display status
          labels including Pending Onboarding, Digital Access Active, Vesting in
          Progress, Fully Service-Eligible, Authorization Restricted, Suspended,
          Expired or Under Review. The Member is responsible for reviewing the
          current membership, payment and benefit status before requesting or
          receiving a service.
        </Paragraph>

        <Subheading>5.8 No Retroactive Service Benefit Before Eligibility</Subheading>
        <Paragraph>
          A monthly subscriber may not request MetroPaws payment, direct provider
          settlement or reimbursement for a service obtained before the applicable
          benefit-eligibility date, even if the Member later completes the required
          monthly installments. Earlier payments do not make prior services payable.
          Any launch-period or exceptional approval must be expressly documented by
          MetroPaws in writing.
        </Paragraph>

        <Subheading>5.9 Annual Payment Exception and Immediate Eligibility</Subheading>
        <Paragraph>
          A Member who pays the approved annual fee in full may be eligible for
          applicable planned-service benefits immediately upon official activation,
          without completing monthly vesting periods, but remains subject to the Plan
          Schedule, waiting periods, service limits, Service Authorization, provider
          availability, exclusions, member share, fraud controls and this Agreement.
        </Paragraph>

        <Subheading>
          5.10 Relationship Between Activation and Service Authorization
        </Subheading>
        <Paragraph>
          Account activation, benefit eligibility, Service Authorization and Provider
          Settlement are separate events. Account activation permits access to the
          MetroPaws platform. Benefit eligibility permits the Member to request a
          covered service. Service Authorization approves a specific provider, pet,
          service, amount and validity period. Provider Settlement occurs only after
          confirmed service completion and billing validation.
        </Paragraph>
      </Clause>

      <Clause id="service-authorization" title="6. Service Authorization Model">
        <Paragraph>
          For planned eligible services, MetroPaws shall ordinarily pay the verified
          provider directly after service completion and validation. The Member must
          obtain advance Service Authorization before relying on MetroPaws payment.

        <Paragraph>
          An authorization is not cash, not a guarantee of treatment, not a guarantee
          of provider acceptance and not final payment. Settlement occurs only after
